# Install mcp-servicedesk

The service desk server as one container (Docker Compose) or one systemd service. It runs behind the MCP gateway; the gateway,
the credential broker, the identity provider and Redis are installed elsewhere. Step by step for a VM: the
[VM installation guide](https://github.com/aiwcorpo/mcp-docs/blob/main/docs/operator/install-vm.md) in `mcp-docs`. The image is built
from the `Dockerfile` in the repository root.

```
deploy/
|-- compose.yaml                 the server as a container (read-only, no capabilities)
|-- mcp-servicedesk.env          settings for Compose: fill in the empty values
|-- certs/                       keystore.p12 and truststore.p12 go here (never committed)
|-- systemd/
|   |-- mcp-servicedesk.service         unit (account mcp, systemd sandbox, logs to journald)
|   `-- mcp-servicedesk.env.template    settings -> /etc/mcp-servicedesk/mcp-servicedesk.env
`-- scripts/
    |-- install.sh               first installation (account, directories, unit)
    |-- update.sh                replaces the jar and keeps a copy for rollback
    `-- healthcheck.sh           /actuator/health over mTLS
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine with Compose v2.20 or newer (or Java 25 and systemd), 1 GiB of memory.
- From your internal CA, a certificate for this server with:
  - CN `mcp-servicedesk` (the gateway takes the server id from it, and the policy data are served only to a CN that is a registered
    server),
  - SAN `mcp-servicedesk.internal` (the gateway checks this name),
  - extended key usage `serverAuth` and `clientAuth`: the gateway connects to the server, and the server connects to the gateway for
    the policy data with the same certificate.

  Also the CA certificate.
- The addresses of the gateway (internal TLS port), of the service desk API (`https`) and of the portal page for connecting an account.
- Redis with an ACL user `mcp-servicedesk` that may run `SET` on `jti:mcp-servicedesk:*`.
- The key of the platform's service account for the service desk, in OpenBao at `mcp/service-accounts/servicedesk` (the broker reads
  it; this server never holds it).

## Install

1. Copy this directory to the host.
2. Put two files in `certs/`:

    | File | What |
    | --- | --- |
    | `keystore.p12` | the server certificate and its key |
    | `truststore.p12` | the internal CA certificate |

    Both stores use one password. From PEM files:

    ```bash
    openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey mcp-servicedesk.key -in mcp-servicedesk.crt -certfile ca.crt -name mcp-servicedesk -out certs/keystore.p12
    keytool -importcert -noprompt -alias ca -file ca.crt -keystore certs/truststore.p12 -storetype PKCS12
    ```

3. Fill in the empty values in `mcp-servicedesk.env`.
4. Start:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

The server starts before the platform knows it. Until an administrator has approved its policies it refuses every call
(`upstream_unavailable`, reason `policies_not_approved` in the audit), which is the state the next section ends.

## Add the server to the platform

Systems and servers are data of the broker and the gateway, not settings of this directory. Nothing restarts, in either direction:
every instance sees a change within a few seconds. Adding, changing and removing need an administrator token with a fresh MFA login
(`mcp-platform-admin`); the portal (Administration) does all of this, and the calls below are the same operations for scripts.

1. **System in the broker.** The service desk is called with one service account of the platform, so the system has the type
   `service-account` only (it cannot be combined with user types):

    ```bash
    curl --cert bff.crt --key bff.key --cacert ca.crt -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'If-None-Match: *' -X PUT https://mcp-credential-broker.corp.internal:8443/v1/admin/systems/servicedesk -d '{
        "baseUrl":"https://servicedesk.corp.internal","adapter":"generic-rest",
        "supportedTypes":["service-account"],"defaultType":"service-account","secretScheme":"ApiKey"}'
    ```

2. **Server in the gateway.** The `serverId` is `mcp-servicedesk`, the address is the internal HTTPS URL of this container or service:

    ```bash
    curl --cert bff.crt --key bff.key --cacert ca.crt -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      https://mcp-gateway.corp.internal:8443/admin/v1/servers -d '{"serverId":"mcp-servicedesk","system":"servicedesk",
      "internalUrl":"https://mcp-servicedesk.corp.internal:8443/mcp","credential":{"required":true,"acceptedTypes":["service-account"],"type":"service-account"}}'
    ```

3. **Deploy** the server as above (`docker compose up -d`, or `deploy/scripts/install.sh` and `systemctl enable --now mcp-servicedesk`).
4. **Register the manifest.** The pipeline of the repository does it with `mcp-app/target/mcp-manifest.json`, the build artifact (it is
   attached to the GitHub Release) and the certificate `mcp-registry-ci-mcp-servicedesk`:

    ```bash
    curl --cert ci.crt --key ci.key --cacert ca.crt -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X PUT \
      https://mcp-gateway.corp.internal:8443/admin/v1/registry/servers/mcp-servicedesk --data-binary @mcp-manifest.json
    ```

    The tools that only read are approved by this call; the tool that changes data (`add_note`), and the policies of the server, wait.
    Until they are approved the server has no tools for anyone.
5. **Approve** the policies (`GET /admin/v1/registry/servers/mcp-servicedesk/policies/pending` shows them, `POST .../policies/approve`
   takes their `policiesHash`) and the tools that wait (`POST /admin/v1/registry/servers/mcp-servicedesk/tools/{tool}/approve`), in the
   portal under Administration, Servers. A later release that changes a policy, a declaration or a tool puts the server in
   `pending_approval` for that part until it is approved again; the server refuses calls with `policies_differ` in the meantime.
6. **Groups.** The server needs the groups `mcp-servicedesk-read`, `mcp-servicedesk-write` and `mcp-servicedesk-destructive` in the
   identity provider (the gateway derives them from the risk of a tool). The service account sees every queue of the service desk,
   so a user reads and changes tickets only in the queues that one of their groups is mapped to; map them in Administration,
   Scope mapping, or with `PUT /admin/v1/policy/scope-mapping` (the whole document, `If-Match` with the `ETag` of the last `GET`):

    ```json
    {"scopeMapping": [{"group": "mcp-servicedesk-queue-IT", "scopes": ["ServiceDesk::Queue/IT"]}]}
    ```

    A user in `mcp-servicedesk-read` and `mcp-servicedesk-queue-IT` may then read the tickets of the queue IT and nothing else; with
    `mcp-servicedesk-write` also add notes there. A user with no queue group gets nothing. Queues that the service desk reports as
    `restricted` are closed to everyone, whatever the groups.

### Remove the server

Delete the server in the gateway (`DELETE /admin/v1/servers/mcp-servicedesk`) and the system in the broker
(`DELETE /v1/admin/systems/servicedesk`). Its tools leave every `tools/list`, calls are refused as for an unknown tool, and the
entries of the scope mapping for `ServiceDesk::Queue` go with it. Then stop the container or the service.

## Policy data

The server pulls the scope mapping, the allowed AI clients (`claude-code`, `claude-ai` by default) and the emergency overrides from
`MCP_GATEWAY_POLICY_DATA_URL` over mTLS with its own certificate, and asks again every 30 seconds (at once when a call carries a newer
revision). A server that cannot reach the gateway at start keeps asking and refuses calls with `policy_data_unavailable`. The
policies themselves are in the jar (`mcp/policies/`); there is nothing to configure for them and no key to distribute.

## Closed network

Copy the image to your registry and point Compose at it in a `.env` file next to `compose.yaml`:

```bash
MCP_REGISTRY=artifactory.corp.test/mcp
```

## Upgrade from 1.x

Version 2.0.0 does not read `MCP_POLICY_URL`, `MCP_POLICY_KEY_ID`, `MCP_POLICY_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE` and `MCP_POLICY_STATE_DIR`, and refuses to
start when they are set through `aiwcorpo.mcp.platform.policy.*`. Remove them (and `StateDirectory=` from a copied systemd unit), set
`MCP_GATEWAY_POLICY_DATA_URL`, and renew the certificate if it has no `clientAuth` usage. Register the new manifest and approve the
policies as above before the first call.
